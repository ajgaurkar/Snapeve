    <string name="user_consent_text_1">CONSENT \n\nThank you for agreeing to participate in our study. \n \n Before we start, weâ€™d like for you to read the informed consent information below. Informed consent refers to the voluntary choice of an individual to participate in research based on an accurate and complete understanding of its purposes, procedures, risks, benefits, and alternatives.  The study will be conducted anonymously and voluntarily.   If you have any questions before completing this study, please contact the investigators, Ajinkya Gaurkar (Faculty Adviser: Dr. Shimei Pan || Email - shimei@umbc.edu) by 240-917-8687 ez55574@umbc.edu  \n\n Informed consent:\n\n You must be of 18 years or older to participate in this experiment. \n\nThe purpose of this study is to understand user behavior in community-based information sharing.\nYou will use an android mobile application to share campus events at UMBC.\n\n During the study, you will: \n\n  1.\tdownload a free mobile application developed by us from Google playstore (limited to android users). \n\n 2.\tparticipate our study using system-assigned user accounts. \n\n 3.\tuse the app to post a campus event, share the event with others and respond to an existing post (e.g., commenting and validating). \n\n 4.\tanswer a survey questionnaire to evaluate the usability of the application.\n\nThe study will last for 4 weeks, during which the app automatically records the usage of various design features such as the frequency of posting, commenting and validating \n\nThe risks involved in participating the study is minimal. Similar to participating in typical social media activities, you may receive a negative comment. It is not an issue, since receiving criticism is expected in social media if it is not inappropriate. There are no tangible benefits for completing the study. But you may receive virtual points/rewards from the app. You may also receive useful information about UMBC campus events. \n\n Participation is entirely voluntary; you may at any time withdraw from participation. \n\n  All data obtained will be anonymous. There is no way for us to find out who you are, and your data will not be shared with any other parties under any circumstance. \n\n This study has been reviewed and approved by the UMBC Institutional Review Board (IRB).  A representative of that Board, from the Office of Research Protections and Compliance, is available to discuss the review process or my rights as a research participant.  Contact information of the Office is (410) 455-2737 or compliance@umbc.edu. \n\n After reading the consent items, click \"Accept and continue\" to get started with the application. If you\'d like to leave the application at any time, just click \"Logout\" from settings menu.</string>
